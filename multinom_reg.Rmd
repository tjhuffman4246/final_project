## Multinomial Regression

Working with random forests was extremely computationally expensive, so here we're altering the model to see if it's feasible to just do multinomial logistic regression instead. The difference between multinomial regression and ordinary logistic regression is that the latter predicts only a binary outcome, while multinomial regression can be extended to predict more than just two outcomes.

```{r load_data}

  files <- dir(path, pattern = "data_\\d{4}.csv", full.names = TRUE)

}

pitches <- load_files("data")

The goal is to accurately predict whether a pitch will be a ball, strike, or hit into play based on characteristics given. We'll create three models and compare them: the first a simple model generating predictions solely from pitch sequence and its associated characteristics (adjusting for batter/pitcher handedness), the second incorporating more granular information about the pitch itself, and the third adjusting for game context. 

```{r model_prep}

# a fair chunk of this code comes from PPBDS
# this first model sees how well we can predict outcome based on comparisons
# with the previous pitch

seq_form <- formula(description ~ pitch_seq * same_handed + speed_diff + 
                      loc_diff_x + loc_diff_z + spin_rate_diff)

# this model includes more information about the pitch itself (not relative)

pitch_form <- update(seq_form, ~ . + release_speed + release_spin_rate + 
                       pfx_x + pfx_z + plate_x + plate_z)

# this model includes contextual information
# specifically, count, outs, inning, baserunners, and score differential
# as well as whether the pitcher is a starter

context_form <- update(pitch_form, ~ . + balls + strikes + outs_when_up +
                         on_3b + on_2b + on_1b + inning + inning_topbot +
                         starter)

# here, we combine all these models into a single tibble

pitch_formulas <- tibble(formula = c(seq_form,
                                     pitch_form,
                                     context_form),
                         group = c("Sequence model",
                                   "Pitch type model",
                                   "Context model"))

# create specifications for classification
# we also create the random forest specification, just in case

multinom_spec <- multinom_reg() %>% 
  set_engine("nnet") %>% 
  set_mode("classification")

rf_spec <- rand_forest() %>%
  set_engine("randomForest") %>%
  set_mode("classification") 

pitches_model <- pitches %>% 
  filter(!is.na(release_speed & pfx_x & pfx_z & plate_x & plate_z &
                  speed_diff & loc_diff_x & loc_diff_z & spin_rate_diff))

```

Now that we've set ourselves up with this model, let's start our process of analysis. The below code gives overall predictions; below, we split into train/test for actual analysis.

```{r run_models}

# more PPBDS code
# cross-validation w/ RF took an incredible amount of time
# and data is big enough that CV isn't as important

seq_form_fit <- fit(multinom_spec, seq_form, data = pitches_model)
pitch_form_fit <- fit(multinom_spec, pitch_form, data = pitches_model)
context_form_fit <- fit(multinom_spec, pitch_form, data = pitches_model)

pitch_preds <- pitches_model %>%
  select(description) %>% 
  mutate(sequence = predict(seq_form_fit, new_data = pitches_model) %>% 
           pull(.pred_class),
         pitch = predict(pitch_form_fit, new_data = pitches_model)  %>% 
           pull(.pred_class),
         context = predict(context_form_fit, new_data = pitches_model)  %>% 
           pull(.pred_class)) %>% 
  na.omit

write_rds(pitch_preds, "shiny_initial/model_preds_standard.rds")

accuracy <- tibble(sequence = mean(pitch_preds$sequence == pitch_preds$description),
                   pitch = mean(pitch_preds$pitch == pitch_preds$description),
                   context = mean(pitch_preds$context == pitch_preds$description))

write_rds(accuracy, "shiny_initial/accuracy_standard.rds")

pitch_preds_simplified <- pitch_preds %>% 
  mutate(description = if_else(description == "in_play", "strike", as.character(description)))

write_rds(pitch_preds_simplified, "shiny_initial/model_preds_simplified.rds")

accuracy_simplified <- tibble(
  sequence = mean(pitch_preds_simplified$sequence == pitch_preds_simplified$description),
  pitch = mean(pitch_preds_simplified$pitch == pitch_preds_simplified$description),
  context = mean(pitch_preds_simplified$context == pitch_preds_simplified$description))

write_rds(accuracy_simplified, "shiny_initial/accuracy_simplified.rds")

```

```{r train_test}

# split model into train and test sets
# first cleans data to exclude NA values

pitch_sample_mod %<>% 
  filter(!is.na(release_speed & pfx_x & pfx_z & plate_x & plate_z &
                  speed_diff & loc_diff_x & loc_diff_z))

set.seed(1005)

pitch_sample_split <- initial_split(pitch_sample_mod, prop = 0.8)
pitch_sample_train <- training(pitch_sample_split)
pitch_sample_test <- testing(pitch_sample_split)

```

Now let's model! We'll start with cross-validation.

```{r cv}

# creates 5 folds for cross-validation

set.seed(1005)

pitch_sample_folds <- pitch_sample_train %>%
  vfold_cv(v = 5)

# uses PPBDS for pretty much all of this
# particularly, we map the fit_resamples() function to each formula

folds_metrics <- pitch_formulas %>%
  mutate(metrics = map(formula, 
                       ~ fit_resamples(multinom_spec, 
                                       preprocessor = .,
                                       resamples = pitch_sample_folds) %>%
                         collect_metrics()))

# now let's check out our results!

folds_metrics %>%
  mutate(mean_acc = map_dbl(metrics, 
                             ~ filter(., .metric == "accuracy") %>% 
                              pull(mean)),
         se_acc = map_dbl(metrics, 
                           ~ filter(., .metric == "accuracy") %>% 
                            pull(std_err))) %>%
  select(group, mean_acc, se_acc) %>% 
  gt()

```

Oof. That didn't seem to work so well. Will we get better results if we replicate this code and use a random forest instead?

```{r cv_rf}

# code replication of what we did above, using a different model specification

folds_metrics <- pitch_formulas %>%
  mutate(metrics = map(formula, 
                       ~ fit_resamples(rf_spec, 
                                       preprocessor = .,
                                       resamples = pitch_sample_folds) %>%
                         collect_metrics()))

# now let's check out our results!

folds_metrics %>%
  mutate(mean_acc = map_dbl(metrics, 
                             ~ filter(., .metric == "accuracy") %>% 
                              pull(mean)),
         se_acc = map_dbl(metrics, 
                           ~ filter(., .metric == "accuracy") %>% 
                            pull(std_err))) %>%
  select(group, mean_acc, se_acc) %>% 
  gt()

```
