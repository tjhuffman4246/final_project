## About

There's more data in baseball than ever now. Whether you're interested in the probability a Mike Trout line drive will fall for a hit, the top speed Ronald Acu√±a Jr. reaches going from first to third, or the precise arm slot at which Josh Hader releases each fastball, these measurements are all available at quite literally the push of a button. Yet with the game becoming viewed by many as a series of sequences and estimations, there remain questions about what hasn't yet been quantified. Some of it is, of course, not truly measurable - one can't reduce a great teammate's impact on the clubhouse to fractions of a win or assess how many points of stolen base percentage a savvy first-base coach might add - but there's still room to improve analysis in certain areas. One of these is pitch sequencing.
