## About

There's more data in baseball than ever now. Whether you're interested in the probability a Mike Trout line drive will fall for a hit, the top speed Ronald Acu√±a Jr. reaches going from first to third, or the precise arm slot at which Josh Hader releases each fastball, these measurements are all available at quite literally the push of a button. Yet with the game becoming viewed by many as a series of sequences and estimations, there remain questions about what hasn't yet been quantified. Some of it is, of course, not truly measurable - one can't reduce a great teammate's impact on the clubhouse to fractions of a win or assess how many points of stolen base percentage a savvy first-base coach might add - but there's still room to improve analysis in certain areas. One of these is pitch sequencing: how to optimize variation in pitch type, speed, and location.

In order to be able to properly analyze the effects of pitch sequencing, pitch-level MLB data is of course required. Thankfully, when MLB introduced Statcast, its player-tracking camera system, in 2015, they made all the data publicly available and accessible via [Baseball Savant](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com), and for this project I collected it using Bill Petti's immensely useful [baseballr package](http://billpetti.github.io/baseballr/). The past two years of data have been found to be more accurate than 2015-2017, but because we're primarily interested in basic pitch data and less so more advanced metrics like spin rate and exit velocity, I feel comfortable using all available Statcast measurements. In order to properly handle the multiple gigabytes worth of data, I used Git LFS and a modified form of Petti's `scrape_statcast_savant` function in order to get the full five regular seasons of data.
